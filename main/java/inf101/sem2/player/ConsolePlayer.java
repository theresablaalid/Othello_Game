/**
 * This Player enables the user to play the game by using the keyboard.
 * There is in reality two different players here,
 * one for TicTacToe and one for FourInARow
 * If you check out the makeMove method it is only an if else choosing between the two types
 * <p>
 * I thought still it was good to keep all this code in one class as then
 * all players can be used in both games.
