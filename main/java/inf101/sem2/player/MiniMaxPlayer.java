/**
 * This AI is based on an algorithm that is not curriculum for INF101, but maybe for INF102.
 * Since many of the students had tried implementing such an AI I have included one in this solution.
 * But such a level of AI is not expected at the level of INF101.
 * <p>
 * This player will work both for TicTacToe and for FourInARow
 * And also for other 2 player games.
 * <p>
 * This player uses a minimax strategy to search for the best move.
 * That means that it tries all possible moves and gives a score to each move.
 * The score is given by calling the method recursively for the other player to
 * make the move that is best for him.
 * We assume that what is best for you is worst for your opponent,
 * otherwise this strategy will not work.
 * <p>
 * In this case we give score 1 for win, score 0 for draw and score -1 for loosing.
 * Note that the sum of the scores for both players always is 0.
