 * Players has only one method that is specific to the game they play.
 * namely getMove(), this method contains the logic of the player.
 * There are normally differences in how a player chooses a move, e.g.
 * in TicTacToe the player chooses x and y while in FourInARow the player
 * chooses a column. Therefore one could imagine that different classes
 * are needed for each type of game.
 * However when possible one should make implement general
 * playing strategies that can be reused in several games.
 * That is done in this solution.
